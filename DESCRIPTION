Description: Provides tools for modeling and analyzing least-cost movement and 
    accessibility based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and friction surfaces. 
    The package includes functions for creating cost surfaces using Tobler's 
    Hiking Function, Irmischer-Clarke's model, and wheeled-vehicle resistance 
    models. Example data from the Heuneburg region in southwestern Germany are included.
